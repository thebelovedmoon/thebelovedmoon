# repository-wide usages of these resources

**most of these resources are provided/commissioned by thebelovedmoon (💚🍃Aga-chuu💗🌸/Emii Shion【絵美紫苑】👑🐣) for use with AuroraLiveVR.**

thebelovedmoon joined the AuroraLiveVR community in light of
Hina's announcement as Suzu Puyotori. continuing the presence
when she retired, he pushed forward the capabilities to
represent the unit he's a part of -- as Emii Shion【絵美紫苑】👑🐣,
Suzu's successor.

currently a part of **Royalence 👑**, he provided the graphics
that represent their unit as a whole. he also provided the
'alternative' version of **KaleidoSekai** -- which distinguishes
well with the rest of ALVR.
