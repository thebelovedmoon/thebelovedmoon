# ciao 🙌

this repository/profile will now be the new home of my web presence as I migrate from Bookmark following its boot-off as indicated in the [Open Letter](https://github.com/MamaNyoSquad/mamanyosquad.github.io/blob/deploy/README.md#An-Open-Letter-to-Bookmark).

# current positions ⭐

- G.Mgr (General Manager), [#MamaNyoSquad](https://github.com/MamaNyoSquad)
- cofounder, [ReactSquad](https://mobile.twitter.com/ReactOSPH)

# what's new with the web presence on this repo? ❓

currently, I'm reworking on the entire web presence to expand my knowledge in effective website building using pure HTML skills. with the help of [hiddenuser0](https://mobile.twitter.com/hiddenuser0), I'm hosting the modifications over his neocities repo. the landing page for [thebelovedmoon_test](https://hiddenuser0.neocities.org/thebelovedmoon_test) is automatically updated under my/his discretion.
