_updated 31 mag 2022_

# ciao 🙌

this repository/profile will now be the new home of my web presence as I migrate from Bookmark following its boot-off as indicated in the [Open Letter](http://github.com/MamaNyoSquad/mamanyosquad.github.io/blob/deploy/README.md#An-Open-Letter-to-Bookmark).

# what's new with the web presence on this repo? ❓

currently, I'm reworking on the entire web presence to expand my knowledge in effective website building using pure HTML skills. with the help of [hiddenuser0](http://mobile.twitter.com/hiddenuser0), I'm hosting the modifications over his neocities repo. the landing page for [thebelovedmoon_test](http://hiddenuser0.neocities.org/thebelovedmoon_test) is automatically updated under my/his discretion.

## planned improvements 🤔

- [x] ⏳ custom wait page based on Windows 11 OOBE
  - [x] 🎞️ custom OOBE collection
- [ ] 📄 **new** landing page (lp.html) for my personal stuff, not based on Bookmark anymore (prettyprinted and preserved)
- [ ] 📄 **new** landing page for Sakura Sumiyoi
  - [ ] 📚 Sakura Curates Mangas (and initial thoughts)

## miscellaneous improvements 💡

- [ ] 🖥️ custom CSS improvements
- [ ] 🎞️ animated overlay
