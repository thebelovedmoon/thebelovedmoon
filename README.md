_info from the official website_

「VTresMarias - V三人のマリア - 」 was provisioned through a fanart from thebelovedmoon (the First Maria🍃) last 27 Dec 2022 as his way of appreciating his fellow VTubers -- Aura Ostara (the Second Maria🪷) and Hina Oujo (the Third Maria🌸).

this VTuber Collective has become the basis for the continuous support of the Marias throughout their VTubing career -- even beyond their hiatus.

in terms of [lore](https://vtresmarias.github.io/story), the Marias' story is culminated -- with the majority being the First Maria🍃's as it encompasses on how she was able to overcome the challenges to complete her underlying mission.

## our Core Values

### 「Universality without Borders」

our primary aim is to be open to all walks of life, whether it would be behind the screen or in front of a real person.

we do not permit any forms of negativity within our community and beyond. we strive to protect and support each other through trying times and not bring them down.

### 「Acceptance without Comprehension」

accompanying our aim for universality is our advocacy to accept everyone's flaws. our community strives on making sure everyone is widely accepted regardless of their nature.

but in order to maintain that acceptance, we have put additional measures to further strengthen our bond and to stay true to our promise of uniting the communities together as one.
