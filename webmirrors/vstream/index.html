      <h1>Adieu.</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>TLDR;</strong>
        VStream has shut down due to running out of money and being unable to
        raise more funds. As of April 1, 2024 the site is now officially
        inaccessible.
      </p>
      <h2>The Situation</h2>
      <p>
        Well, this was not a post I ever wanted to write. But, as you just read
        in the TL;DR, after nearly 2 years VStream has shut down as of April
        1st, 2024. At this time, we have shut down all of the video and web
        servers and the site is no longer accessible. Unfortunately, we have run
        too low on cash, have failed to secure funds after attempting to
        fundraise in early 2024, and it&rsquo;s sadly time for us to wave the
        white flag.
      </p>
      <p>
        We&rsquo;re so proud of the tech and the platform we were able to create
        in such a short amount of time. The entire VTeam is incredibly
        disappointed that this was the outcome, but more than that, we&rsquo;re
        sad that we&rsquo;re disappointing you all; the VStream community. So
        many of you have been cheering us on these past few years and truly
        believed in the mission and vision of VStream. We never could have made
        it this far without all of your support!
      </p>
      <p>
        Even though this is the end of VStream, this is not the end of the
        VTubing movement. I&rsquo;m still a huge believer in VTubers and how
        they represent the future when it comes to entertainment online. VTubers
        deserve better than what they can get with existing platforms. And a
        platform like VStream will exist in the future, we may have just been
        too early. In the future, I hope people look back on VStream as one of
        the pioneers in the space. Walking, and stumbling, so that others later
        can run.
      </p>
      <h2>Thank You</h2>
      <p>
        While there are too many people to thank, we do want to give special
        shoutouts to a few folks who went above and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Chisei</strong>
        - Thank you for being one of the earliest champions of VSteam. You
        introduced so many people to our community before we even had a real
        site launched. You and the community you brought gave us early hope that
        what we were building was meaningful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Angora, Tymora, Marien</strong>
        - Thank you for making up Wave 0. You three were willing to test out
        streaming with us before we really had a working site at all. It feels
        like you&apos;ve always been there and have been a huge source of
        comfort through the good and bad times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>BloodyDi</strong>
        - Thank you for being the first person to sign up to be a wave member
        and for streaming with us even after so many other wave members moved
        on. Your feedback and excitement was motivation for everyone on the
        team.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Himedae and Safi</strong>
        - Thank you for being some of the first streamers to go
        &quot;full-time&quot; with VStream. You put your trust in us so early
        and we will always be grateful for that. I&apos;m sorry we couldn&apos;t
        be your forever home.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bakuma and Panku</strong> - Thank you for creating amazing tools
        for our creators. If it wasn&apos;t for your efforts no one would have
        access to chat overlays or alerts. You all made VStream come alive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jak, Gucci</strong> - Thank you all for being amazing community
        moderators. Almost always a thankless task, but you never shied away
        from an awkward situation. Your efforts helped to make the VStream
        community feel like a safe place for everyone.
      </p>

        - Thank you all for being the best VTeam one could dream to work with.
        Every one of you worked incredibly hard on building the best possible
        platform we could. You all are so talented and it was so nice to work
        with each and every one of you. I truly hope we get a chance to work
        together again in the future.

        While this may be it for now, none of us are going to disappear from the
        internet. We&apos;ll be around and cheering on the next wave from the
        sidelines. Thank you all again for your support these past few years. It
        was a dream to work on this product for this community and I don&apos;t
        regret it for a second.

        <h2>Q & A</h2>
        <h3>
          I&rsquo;m a fan that had subscriptions to creators, how do I cancel
          them all now that the site is shut down?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We have cancelled all ongoing subscriptions. If you notice any issues,
          please contact the support team.
        </p>
        <h3>Wait, Eric and E were the same person?!</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, I&apos;m sorry you had to find out this way. If you already knew,
          but played along, thank you; you&apos;re a real one.
        </p>
        <h3>This is upsetting, I&apos;m upset!</h3>
        <p>
          We&apos;re sorry! But things in life often don&apos;t go the way we
          plan. We truly wish this wasn&apos;t the outcome as well.
        </p>
        <h3>I&apos;m not upset, VStream was dumb</h3>
        <p>
          Okay, I feel like we&apos;re getting away from the whole &quot;<strong
            >questions</strong
          >
          and answers thing.&quot; I&apos;m sorry we didn&apos;t get a chance to
          prove you wrong.
        </p>
        <h3>What&apos;s going to happen to the Discord server?</h3>
        <p>
          The VStream discord server has been a place to come together and
          discuss all things VStream for the past 2 years. That said, without
          VStream there doesn&apos;t seem like a good reason to keep it around.
          We&apos;ll keep it going for another month, but we&apos;re planning on
          shutting it down on May 1st.
        </p>
